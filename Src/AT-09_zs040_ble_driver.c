It was concluded that the HM-10 Clone BLE device could only receive a maximum of 18 ASCII characters from a single request, which means that if more data is to be received, this would have to be broke into several parts with a maximum size of 18 bytes each. @note Since the restriction of receiving data is of 18 bytes per request, to manage things homogeneously, both the transmit and receive requests will be managed with the same size of 18 bytes. */
