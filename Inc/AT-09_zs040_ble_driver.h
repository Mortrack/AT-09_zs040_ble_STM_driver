 * @brief	AT-09 CTFZ54812 ZS-040 Bluetooth Clone Device's driver Header file.
 *
 * @defgroup hm10_ble_clone AT-09 CTFZ54812 ZS-040 Bluetooth Clone module
 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This module provides the functions, definitions, structures and variables required to enable an
 *          STMicroelectronics MCU/MPU's application to be able to Configure, Initialize and Send and/or Receive data
 *          to/from a AT-09 CTFZ54812 ZS-040 Bluetooth Device, which is actually a clone of the HM-10 Bluetooth Device.
 *
 * @details As for now, this @ref hm10_ble_clone provides you with the necessary things so that you can configure and
 *          use an AT-09 Clone BLE Device in peripheral mode only.
 *
 * @note    Although you can also configure it as Central mode with this module, all the available functions,
 *          definitions and structures to use that mode have not yet been implemented. The reason for this is because
 *          during the tests conducted with that Device, it was identified that a lot of the required functionalities to
 *          properly use the device in its Central Mode either do not work in the Clone Model (which does work in the
 *          Original Model) or the way in which it can be made to work could not be figured our in this work.
 * @note    Among the several functions required and that the Clone Model lacks for the Central Mode to work properly,
 *          the most important one was that an AT-09 in Central Mode can connect to another AT-09 in Slave Mode, but no
 *          successful data transfer could be achieved after that (only data transfer from the Central Mode device to
 *          the Slave Mode device was attempted), making the use of this module almost to make no sense. These data
 *          transfers were also attempted from an original HM-10 Device in Central Mode towards an AT-09 in Slave Mode,
 *          but these attempts were also unsuccessful.Yet, only by using a Mobile App such as BLE Terminal or LightBlue,
 *          could these data transfers be achieved successfully.
 * @note    As for other functions required and that did not work we have that you will not be able to disconnect the
 *          AT-09 Clone BLE Device after connecting it with another BLE Device (regardless if your Device is in
 *          Peripheral or in Central Mode). However, you could make an external circuitry to electrically shut-down and
 *          then turn on the device to reset it in order to force it to disconnect. Despite this, whenever using Central
 *          Mode, this Clone Device will not provide sufficient information so that the user, or even the implementer,
 *          can guess to what slave BLE Device your Central mode BLE Device should connect to, especially in the case
 *          that it was intended for it to connect with new BLE devices overtime for a certain type of application.
 *          However, it could work out for you if you would, perhaps make a particular and specific system in which you
 *          plan to always connect to the same slave BLE Device and where you already know before-hand the address of
 *          that slave BLE Device of interest, unless the Clone BLE Device in Central Mode that you have simply does not
 *          work for transmitting data to a slave device, which is what happened to me. However, according to several
 *          sources I reviewed on the internet, some Clone BLE Devices can transmit data to a slave device once a BLE
 *          Connection has been made.
 * @note    Despite all this, you should keep in mind that you will not be able to connect your Central Mode BLE Device
 *          with more than one slave device. This is not only because of the limitation of not being able to disconnect
 *          them from the Central Mode Device in the case of not disposing of an external circuit as previously
 *          mentioned, but also because the Clone BLE device in Central mode automatically reconnects to the last
 *          connected slave BLE Device. This means, that your only choice there would be to turn off the Clone Slave
 *          Device before electrically resetting the Clone BLE Device so that the Central Clone Device does not
 *          automatically reconnect to the slave device, where you will have to either send a command to the Central
 *          Device to make it stop connecting to the Slave Device (AT command not yet implemented here) or to change the
 *          configurations of your Central Device to Default (AT command that not yet been implemented here) and then
 *          reconfigure it again to connect to another slave BLE Device.
 * @note    Nonetheless, because these complications really limit the use of this HM-10 Clone BLE Device in Central
 *          mode, the author of this @ref hm10_ble_clone suggests using this Clone Model only in Peripheral Mode, and
 *          whenever you want to transfer data between these type of devices, then either do it with a
 *          <a href=http://www.jnhuamao.cn/bluetooth.asp>Genuine HM-10 BLE Device</a> in order to guarantee that it will
 *          work or
 *          <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez3491-v8Og>try flashing the Genuine Firmware into a HM-10 Clone BLE Device</a>
 *          instead.
 * @note    On the other hand, make sure to supply to the HM-10 Clone BLE Device with the right Voltage Power Supply,
 *          which is 3.6v-6v (I used 5v and it worked correctly with it) so that the BLE module of that device's PCB
 *          board works correctly. This is very important, because you could get the wrong idea that this Device can
 *          work with a lower voltage (e.g., I tried with 3.3v) because its UART module can work with even 3.3v, but its
 *          actual BLE module will not work most of the time and you will have a very rough time trying to connect with
 *          the device and to make it work correctly.
 * @note    Another thing to highlight is that this @ref hm10_ble_clone has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h" header file
 *          to be able to use the UART in this module. However, this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1
 *          series devices. If yours is from a different type, then you will have to substitute the right one here for
 *          your particular STMicroelectronics device. However, if you cant figure out what the name of that header file
 *          is, then simply substitute that line of code from this @ref hm10_ble_clone by: #include "main.h"
 *
 * @details While it is not necessary to use all the entirety of the functions provided to use the HM-10 Clone BLE
 *          Device in peripheral mode, the following code example demonstrate how to use them in case that its
 *          implementer requires an application reference:
